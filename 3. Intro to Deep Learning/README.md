### [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)
> Use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.
- create a fully-connected neural network architecture
- apply neural nets to two classic ML problems: regression and classification
- train neural nets with stochastic gradient descent, and
- improve performance with dropout, batch normalization, and other techniques
